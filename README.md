# Order-Management-Application

The GUI is fully functional and can only be logged in through database stored user credentials. "Alice" or "Bob" being the usernames and "123" being the passwords. Once access is obtained the users name will be displayed at the top of the order form depending on who logged in. From there the user can then add or remove any order and receive a total for the order made.
